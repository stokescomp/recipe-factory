			<p>Michael, a computer programmer, was raised in a very health - conscious family. Growing up, most of the foods that he ate, were completely made from scratch, including homemade wheat bread. He could live happily off of a diet consisting mainly of fruits, and vegetables, and did so, for many years of his single life. Unlike Christina, his diet choices have been influenced more by how he was raised, than any dire health needs, and he has enjoyed the occasional pizza, candy bars, and baked or fried foods, but his less healthy choices tended to happen several times a year, simply because those foods don’t appeal, to him.</p>
			<p>Christina grew up in a home slightly less health-oriented. While it is true that she only ate out at fast food restaurants several times a year, much of her diet consisted of foods from a package, box, or can, with very little prep time, and often far fewer nutrients. In high school, she started getting headaches, which later turned into daily migraines. Her health problems progressively advanced to a point where she struggled with lower - back pain, constipation, low energy, and a difficulty thinking and focusing. At age 19, she moved in with a family who introduced her to their allergist. It was then that she found out she had many of the same allergies as those in this particular family. Changing her diet played a huge role in getting all of her health problems to go away, in just a few short months. A year of living with this loving family gave her, among other things, the opportunity to re-learn how to cook around her dietary needs, which included a few allergies, in each food group. Once she learned the basics of how to cook, she discovered how much fun it was, to take “regular” recipes and “tweak” them, by changing just a few ingredients, so that she could enjoy the same foods as her friends, made with slightly different ingredients. </p>

			<p>She lived quite comfortably with such a strict diet, for about 5 years, but her diet tended to consist of large amounts of meat and rice. When her health problems started to get worse, she changed allergists, and had a few appointments with him until things stabilized.</p> 
			<p>One of Michael and Christina’s first dates consisted of the two of them making a gluten-free pizza with a white sauce, instead of tomato sauce. As they got to know each other better, they did much of their grocery shopping together, and learned to combine his fruit and vegetable diet with her meat and rice diet.</p>
			<p>The stress of being engaged caused Christina’s allergies to worsen, temporarily. Because of this, after getting married, she picked up where she left off, in her previous allergy appointments. However this time, she did so on a more regular basis, and has been able to add many of the foods back into her diet, with little to no problems, that she had been forced to avoid since 2007. Michael has such a love of cooking, that he has been a big support to Christina, in teaching her how to cook from scratch, using the foods, like tomatoes, cheese, and peppers, that she is less familiar with as she adds them into her diet.</p>
			<p>Together, Michael and Christina have combined their knowledge of food with Michael’s computer skills, and Christina’s desire to help those striving to improve their health through dietary changes. We hope that this website helps you.</p>
